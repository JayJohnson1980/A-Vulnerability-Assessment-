# Vulnerability Assessment in Cyber Security

### Overview

Vulnerability assessment in cyber security involves identifying, classifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and network infrastructures. This process helps organizations understand their security posture and address weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.

## Tools for Vulnerability Assessment

### Nikto

Description: Nikto is an open-source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version-specific problems on over 270 servers.

### Features:

Detects server configuration issues such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software.
Scans for outdated software versions, insecure files, and misconfigurations.
Supports SSL and can scan HTTPS websites.
Easily extensible with plugins.

## Wapiti

Description: Wapiti is another open-source tool that performs black-box testing to assess the security of web applications. It can detect vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), file disclosure, command execution, and more.

## Features:

Scans web applications for various vulnerabilities without accessing the source code.
Supports multiple attack modules, including XSS, SQL injection, file inclusion, and more.
Generates detailed reports in various formats (HTML, XML, JSON).
Can differentiate between static and dynamic pages for more accurate scanning.
Process of Vulnerability Assessment Using Nikto and Wapiti

### Preparation:

Define the scope of the assessment, including which systems and applications to scan.
Obtain necessary permissions to avoid legal issues and ensure ethical use.
Running Nikto:

Execute Nikto to scan the web server by specifying the target URL. Example command:
arduino
Copy code
```
nikto -h http://example.com
```
Analyze the output for potential vulnerabilities, such as outdated server versions, insecure files, and misconfigurations.
Running Wapiti:

Execute Wapiti by specifying the target URL and desired modules. Example command:
arduino
Copy code
```
wapiti http://example.com -m all
```
Review the results to identify vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, file inclusion, and others.

### Analysis and Reporting:

Consolidate findings from both tools.
Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and the potential impact on the organization.
Generate a comprehensive report detailing the vulnerabilities, their risk levels, and recommended remediation steps.

### Remediation:

Address the identified vulnerabilities by applying patches, updating configurations, and implementing security best practices.
Conduct follow-up scans to ensure that vulnerabilities have been properly mitigated.


### Continuous Monitoring:

Integrate regular vulnerability assessments into the organization's security routine to maintain a strong security posture.
Stay updated on new vulnerabilities and emerging threats.

### Conclusion

Nikto and Wapiti are powerful tools for performing vulnerability assessments in web environments. By systematically identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of cyber attacks and enhance their overall security posture. Regular use of these tools, combined with a comprehensive security strategy, helps ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats.
